# Jellyfin client sdk

Docs website - https://jellydart-docs.vercel.app/

This is a mostly autogenerated library using open api spec and (oapi generator)[https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator]

The project uses the npm version of the cli.

This will also contain some patches, that the auto generation gets wrong. More info can be found [**here**](./custom_docs/getting_started.md)

## Updating api

```
openapi-generator-cli generate -i .\jelly-10-8.json -o jellydart -g dart -c config.yaml
```
